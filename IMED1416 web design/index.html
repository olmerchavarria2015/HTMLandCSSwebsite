                <h3>Before You Start</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are suffering from any condition that affects or hinders the normal functions of your body, we highly recommend to consult a doctor before you start a diet or exercise plan.
                </p>
                <h3>The importance of good nutrition</h3>
                <p>
                    Eating a balanced diet is vital for good health and wellbeing. Food provides our bodies with the energy, protein, essential fats, vitamins and minerals to live, grow and function properly. We need a wide variety of different foods to provide the right amounts of nutrients for good health. Enjoyment of a healthy diet can also be one of the great cultural pleasures of life. An unhealthy diet increases the risk of many diet-related diseases.
                </p>
                <h3>Important terms to remember</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Macros or Macronutrients</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Macronutrients are the largest class of nutrients the body requires and include protein, carbohydrates, and fats. If you’ve heard anyone talking about “macros,” they’re referring to these major nutrients. The amounts and ratio of macronutrients a person needs every day vary by age, lifestyle (sedentary, active, or very active), gender, health status, and health goals.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Calorie</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A unit of energy. In nutrition and everyday language, calories refer to energy consumption through eating and drinking, and energy usage through physical activity.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Empty Calorie</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Calories derived from food containing little to no nutrients at all.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Daily Calorie intake</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The amount of calories obtained through food consumed in one day.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Super Foods</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Foods containing high amounts of nutrients</dd>
                </dl>
                <h3>The 2000 calorie a day Diet</h3>
                <p>
                    When developing the new food label, the Food and Drug Administration needed a base for % Daily Values — a new feature to help customers see at a glance the fat and other nutrient content of a certain food. A mathematically simple 2,000 calorie-a-day diet was chosen so that consumers could easily calculate the Daily Values needed for their own diets. This diet was designed based on what the calorie intake of a middle age woman(weighing around132 pounds) needed to maintain her weight. In other words this diet is just a point of reference. The optimal calorie intake will vary from person to person.
                </p>
                <h3>How much should I eat then?</h3>
                <p>To calculate your optimal calorie intake visit the Calorie Calculator on <a href="http://www.calculators.org/health/weight-loss.php">this website</a>, However, regardless of what you eat, you should be gettting:</p>
                <p>12 to 20 percent of your total daily calories should come from protein.</p>

                <p>50 to 60 percent of your total daily calories should come from carbohydrate.</p>
                        <br>

                <p>30 percent of total daily calories should come from fat.</p>
