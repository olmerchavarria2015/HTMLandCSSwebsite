                <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
                <p>
                    Carbohydrates are the sugars, starches and fibers found in fruits, grains, vegetables and milk products. Though often maligned in trendy diets, carbohydrates — one of the basic food groups — are important to a healthy life. "Carbohydrates are macronutrients, meaning they are one of the three main ways the body obtains energy, or calories," said Paige Smathers, a Utah-based registered dietitian. The American Diabetes Associationnotes that carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy. They are called carbohydrates because, at the chemical level, they contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are three macronutrients: carbohydrates, protein and fats, Smathers said. Macronutrients are essential for proper body functioning, and the body requires large amounts of them. All macronutrients must be obtained through diet; the body cannot produce macronutrients on its own.The recommended daily amount (RDA) of carbs for adults is 135 grams, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH); however, the NIH also recommends that everyone should have his or her own carbohydrate goal. Carb intake for most people should be between 45 and 65 percent of total calories. One gram of carbohydrates equals about 4 calories, so a diet of 1,800 calories per day would equal about 202 grams on the low end and 292 grams of carbs on the high end. However, people with diabetes should not eat more than 200 grams of carbs per day, while pregnant women need at least 175 grams.

                <h3>Good carbs vs. bad carbs</h3>
                    <p>Carbohydrates are found in foods you know are good for you (vegetables) and ones you know are not (doughnuts). This has led to the idea that some carbs are "good" and some are "bad." According to Healthy Geezer Fred Cicetti, carbs commonly considered bad include pastries, sodas, highly processed foods, white rice, white bread and other white-flour foods. These are foods with simple carbs. Bad carbs rarely have any nutritional value. Carbs usually considered good are complex carbs, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans and legumes. These are not only processed more slowly, but they also contain a bounty of other nutrients.

                <strong>List of Nutricious Carbs</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Oatmeal (old fashioned or Steel Cut)</li>
                    <li>Yams (almost same as sweet potatoes)</li>
                    <li>Brown rice (love basmati, a long grain rice)</li>
                    <li>Sweet potatoes</li>
                    <li>Multi grain hot cereal (mix or barley, oats, rye, triticale, and a few others)</li>
                    <li>Beans and lentils (great for healthy chili recipes)</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Important Note</strong>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 100px;">
                    Every type of carbohydrate varies in caloric and fat content.
                    You should refer to its nutritional value sheet if you are counting your macros in order to find the ideal amount to consume.
